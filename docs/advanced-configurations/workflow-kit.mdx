Foresight's [Workflow Kit](https://github.com/runforesight/foresight-workflow-kit-action) is to track and monitor the resource metrics of your GitHub Action workflow runs. 
If the run is triggered via a Pull Request, it will create a comment on the connected PR 
with the results and/or publishes the results to the job summary. The action collects the 
following metrics:

- CPU Load (user and system) in percentage
- Memory usage (used and free) in MB
- Network I/O (receive and transmit) in MB
- Disk I/O (read and write) in MB

## Usage

To use the action, add the following step before the steps you want to track.

```yaml
- name: Collect Workflow Telemetry
  uses: runforesight/foresight-workflow-kit-action@v1
  if: success() || failure()
  with:
    api_key: <foresight_api_key>
```
