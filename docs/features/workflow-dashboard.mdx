Foresight's **workflows dashboard** is designed to help users easily monitor and track the performance of workflows over time.

Workflow dashboard combines the functionality of the Repositories view and the Highlights and allows you to **filter for workflows over time, branch, and name**. 
This means that you can **quickly identify and address any issues with workflows** that are not being fixed or are slow.
Additionally, you can search by workflow name, making it easy to **focus on specific workflows** across multiple repositories.

## Filter workflows
You can **pick a date** from the date picker, above the workflow table. Beware that if you are using Foresight on Free and Standard package, data retention is 30 days.

To **focus on specific status, repository and branch;** use advanced filter button on the top right.
