Foresight's **workflows dashboard** is designed to help users easily monitor and track the performance of workflows over time.

Workflow dashboard combines the functionality of the Repositories view and the Highlights and allows you to **filter for workflows over time, branch, and name**. 
This means that you can **quickly identify and address any issues with workflows** that are not being fixed or are slow.
Additionally, you can search by workflow name, making it easy to **focus on specific workflows** across multiple repositories.
