# Flaky tests 

## What is a Flaky test?
Flaky tests are tests that fail to produce a consistent result, despite no changes to the code or the test itself. [Learn more from our blog](https://www.runforesight.com/blog/5-causes-of-flaky-tests-and-how-to-mitigate-them).

## How Foresight detects flaky tests?
:::info PREREQUISITE 
You need to integrate [Foresight's Test Kit](/advanced-configuration/test-kit) action into your CI pipeline. Then, Foresight automatically captures your
test report and shows you the details of your tests and test suite performance. 
:::

In order Foresight to detect a failed test, a test case needs to be re-ran until it succeeds, with no code change. For instance:
- ❌ Test failed, re-run
- ❌ Test failed, re-run
- ✅ Test succeed. Foresight marks this test case as **flaky** on that test run. 


You can find **Flakiness Severity** inside the test suite details.
- **Urgent:** test marked as flaky more than 75% of the test runs
- **High:** test marked as flaky more than 50% of the test runs
- **Mid:** test marked as flaky more than 25% of the test runs
- **Low:** test marked as flaky at least 1 time.

## Language & framework support
:::info
A test needs to be a re-ran in case a failure to marked as flaky. You will find some retry & rerun plugin examples for different language options. However,
you can use other rerun plugins too.

### Cypress

#### Foresight Test Kit Configuration
You need to use CYPRESS with JSON format. In order Cypress to generate JSON file, you can achieve this by adding `|& tee results.json` after your test command.
```yaml 
## Example Foresight Test Kit Configuration for JEST / JSON
...
    test_framework: CYPRESS
    test_format: JSON
...
```
#### Example test command for Cypress
```javascript
cypress run --record false --reporter json |& tee results.json
```

### Jest

#### Foresight Test Kit Configuration
You need to use JEST with JSON format.

```yaml 
## Example Foresight Test Kit Configuration for JEST / JSON
...
    test_framework: JEST
    test_format: JSON
...
```

You can set a global retry mechanism:
- Create a file named `setup.jest.js` and add the following:
```javascript
// you can change 3 as your retry preference
jest.retryTimes(3)
```
- Go to `jest.config.js`
- Add `setupFilesAfterEnv: [‘./setup-jest.js’]`

### Pytest

#### Foresight Test Kit Configuration
You need to use PYTEST with JSON format.

```yaml 
## Example Foresight Test Kit Configuration for PYTEST / JSON
...
    test_framework: PYTEST
    test_format: JSON
...
```

#### pytest-rerunfailures
`pytest-rerunfailures` is a plugin for pytest that re-runs tests to eliminate intermittent failures.

```python
pip install pytest-rerunfailures
```

After installing `pytest-rerunfailures` you can set its rerun count as a variable:
```python
pytest --reruns 5 --json-report --json-report-file=report.json
```

### Mocha
### Golang
