# Flaky tests 

## What is a Flaky test?
Flaky tests are tests that fail or succeed seemingly randomly when executed on the exact same code. 

## How Foresight detects flaky tests
You need to integrate Foresight's Test Kit action into your CI pipeline. Then, Foresight automatically captures your
test report and shows you the details of your tests and test suite performance. 

In order Foresight to detect a failed test, a test case needs to be re-ran until it succeed. For instance:
- ❌ Test failed, re-run
- ❌ Test failed, re-run
- ✅ Test succeed. Foresight marks this test case as **flaky** on that test run. 


In the test suite details, you will see **Flakiness Severity**
- **Urgent:** test marked as flaky more than 75% of the test runs
- **High:** test marked as flaky more than 50% of the test runs
- **Mid:** test marked as flaky more than 25% of the test runs
- **Low:** test marked as at least 1 time

A test needs to be a re-ran in case a failure to marked as flaky. You can find some retry plugins and libraries for different languages.

### Cypress

#### Foresight Test Kit Configuration
You need to use CYPRESS with JSON format. In order Cypress to generate JSON file, you need to add `|& tee results.json` after your test command.
```yaml 
## Example Foresight Test Kit Configuration for JEST / JSON
...
    test_framework: CYPRESS
    test_format: JSON
...
```
#### Example test command for Cypress
```javascript
cypress run --record false --reporter json |& tee results.json
```

### Jest

#### Foresight Test Kit Configuration
You need to use JEST with JSON format.

```yaml 
## Example Foresight Test Kit Configuration for JEST / JSON
...
    test_framework: JEST
    test_format: JSON
...
```

You can set a global retry mechanism as following:
- Add a file as `setup.jest.js` and add the following:
```javascript
// you can change 3 as your retry preference
jest.retryTimes(3)
```
- Go to `jest.config.js`
- Add `setupFilesAfterEnv: [‘./setup-jest.js’]`

### Pytest

#### Foresight Test Kit Configuration
You need to use PYTEST with JSON format.

```yaml 
## Example Foresight Test Kit Configuration for PYTEST / JSON
...
    test_framework: PYTEST
    test_format: JSON
...
```

#### pytest-rerunfailures
`pytest-rerunfailures` is a plugin for pytest that re-runs tests to eliminate intermittent failures.

```python
pip install pytest-rerunfailures
```

After installing `pytest-rerunfailures` you can set its rerun count as a variable:
```python
pytest --reruns 5 --json-report --json-report-file=report.json
```
